      <li>Designed a model based on lightGBM and Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) to detect potential network breakdowns and help troubleshooting. (final accuracy around 85%)</li>
      <li>Extended the usage of SN-GANs (spectral normalization GANs)to network tra c data synthesis and compared the model behaviour between Wasserstein distance and KL divergence as similarity measurement.</li>
