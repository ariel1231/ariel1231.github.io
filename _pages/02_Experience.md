<ul class = "secondary_list">
      <li>Proposed a VAE based text simulation model. A two-layer Conditional Random Field model is used to replace the output of the encoder.The score function is changed as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)  and a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network.</li>
      <li>Developed a text generation model for simulation of transaction information and improved the readability using reinforcement learning techniques and altered the objective function to reduce text repetition.</li>
      <li>Designed a model based on xgboost and Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) to detect potential network breakdowns and help troubleshooting. (final accuracy around 85%)</li>
      <li>Extended the usage of SN-GANs (spectral normalization GANs)to network tra c data synthesis and compared the model behaviour between Wasserstein distance and KL divergence as similarity measurement.</li>

      <li>Successfully identified 20 genes out of 12023 of them which have discriminatory power for early diagnosis of the infection of upper respiratory virus(over 90% balanced success rate/accuracy).</li>
      <li>Tackled the severe sample imbalance problem using SMOTE and GANs.</li>
      <li>Helped in the development of a python based machine learning packages
      named CALCOM for calculate and compare.
