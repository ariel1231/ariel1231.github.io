<p class = "about_me_content">
I'm Xiaoyu Liu and I usually go by Ariel.<br>
I'm currently a Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments. My work here involves creating machine learning models for extracting semantic information from unstructured/structured internal web content,data simulation and network traffic troubleshooting.<br>
I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from Colorado State University in United States.
As an undergraduate I did research under the supervision of Prof.Michael Kirby ,as a member of Pattern Analysis Laboratory and helped develop a python based machine learning packages named CALCOM (as "compare and compute") for DNA/RNA analysis.<br>
Generally speaking, my research interest is to develop/optimize models that learn patterns from massive data sources.(as in information extraction from natural language, bio-informatics etc.) One interesting project that I am working on is to apply GANs and VAE to simulate structured text and further improve the performance by optimizing the tensor structure with some manifold learning algorithms.
